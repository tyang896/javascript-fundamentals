# Javascript Quiz

## Description

This is a timed quiz application I created. The purpose of this project was to make an application using DOM and javascript web APIs. It has basic functionality that works, but still needs some improvements to the appearance and javascript code. 

Currently, this application is flexible for creating any timed multiple choice questionnaire. I'm still learning how different variables are affected according to where they were locally or globally placed.

## Installation

1. Open your terminal or comand prompt.
2. Use the `cd` command to move to your desired installation directory.
3. Copy and paste the following command on to your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:tyang896/javascript-fundamentals.git
```
You can view a live demonstration of the web application here: https://tyang896.github.io/javascript-fundamentals/
